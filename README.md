# Bonjour Menu

This is a simple menu bar app for macOS.

It uses Bonjour to look for Web Sites and PostgreSQL servers on the local network.

Selecting a server connects to it by opening the advertised URL (PostgreSQL servers work best with Postico!).

It's very simple, so it's perfect to use as a starting point for building your own menu bar apps.

If you have any questions, please open an issue! 

All questions are welcome, even if you are a total Swift / Xcode newbie.
